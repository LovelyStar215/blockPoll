# blockPoll

blockPoll is a pseudo-anonymous, online, blockchain-based voting tool, used to facilitate organizational-based proxy voting and polling mechanisms for a wide array of uses.

## What is it

By leveraging the power of the Etherium blockchain, coupled with an easy to use web API, blockpoll provides a mechanism whereby both corporate and non-corporate organisations can conduct voting or polling-like events in a decentralised manner. During the voting process, all participants (voters and candidates) are able to see in real-time the progress results of the undertaken vote without anyone other than the registrar(s) being able to see which voter voted for which candidate. <br> The final tallied outcome of the vote is also publicly accessible to all members, with the same level of anonymity discussed above. The creator of the vote is able to specify the type of proxy voting procedure (partial, non-partial) as well as user decided input arguments decided upon during contract creation.

## How it works

Given a list of potential candidates, as well as the those who are eligible within the organization to vote for said candidates (Decided upon by a central authorizing committee within the organization), the tool allows an administrative user to create both partial or non-partial proxy voting schemes. By uploading a CSV file of the voters and their associated voting power, the voting participants are randomly bound to a voting Id generated by the tool. The Id of each voter and the numerical representation of their voting power is made publically available, but the Id-voter pair is known only by the administrator/registrar and the voter itself. By displaying the Id of each voter, as well as who that Id voted for, the current progress of the voting process can be displayed to each voter and candidate. This means that the voter is able to verify that his/her vote has been logged correctly while still preserving the anonymity of the voter. An ethereum deployed smart contract manages the creation, tallying of votes and deletion of each instantiated voting contract. This allows for complete immutability of all results, and prevents those with malicious intent from interfering with the voting process or the results they produce. Additionally, after creation, as long as the voting process has not yet begun (Start and end date/time decided upon by administrator of the contract through by specifying block numbers), the administrator is able to delete the contract in the event of a miscreated poll. However, once the specified begin block has been mined, the contract cannot be deleted, preserving its immutability and transparency for the benefit of both those who are voting and the candidates being voted for.

## Why it works

Why choose blockPoll over current proxy voting mechanisms?

### Current voting mechanisms
In a corporate business context, proxy voting allows for a ballot to be cast by one person on behalf of a shareholder of a corporation. This allows for the vote to be conveniently cast without the shareholder having to attend a shareholders meeting. These shareholders receive a ballot - either by mail, internet or, in some cases, over the phone - along with an information booklet called a proxy statement. This statement outlines the circumstances surrounding the vote including new board electives, merger or acquisition approval, stock compensation, inter-office policies etc. Additionally, the proxy statement asserts whether the vote  is:

* **Non-Partial** -- The vote is carried out in a binary type manner, ie: YES, NO or - in some cases - ABSTAIN. In circumstances where a specific candidate or event is being voted for, the voter is only allowed to vote for one candidate. Here the voter is forced to assign the full weight of their shareholding power behind their vote meaning that they are only allowed to vote for one candidate (event) and they are only allowed to vote once. 
* **Partial** -- Depending on the voting circumstances, the voter is able to assign all or only part of their voting power to a candidate (event). This means that the voter is able to vote more than once for multiple different candidates (events), splitting their voting power between candidates in however incremental portion they choose. The voter is able to do this until all of his/her weighting power has been assigned to their chosen voting candidate(s). 

Once the vote is cast, a central tallying authority is responsible for ensuring that the voting process was conducted fairly 
and - depending on the type of system used - the votes have been recorded and tallied correctly ensuring the validity of the winning candidate.

### How does blockPoll improve on these mechanisms?

#### Immutability
The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus protocol used by the Ethereum network ensures that once all nodes have agreed on its state, no one node has the power to falsify the data or to censor changes. As such, once the contract has been deployed and the start block has been mined, no individual can alter the state of the contract and in such disrupt the validity of the vote. Any change to the contract would result in a disagreement between the nodes. This gives both voters and voting candidates the peace of mind that the result of the vote has not been altered or tampered with during its life cycle. This relegates the voters and candidates from the need of a central tallying authority and removes the need to trust in these entities.

#### Auditability and Transparency

Because a blockchain requires that there exist a ledger containing the sequential time-stamped trial of transactions, and these transactions are stored in a sequential array of blocks containing reference to their predecessors, an audible trial of transactions is created which can be publicly viewed. This blockPoll leverages this, allowing voters to validate that their vote has been captured correctly, without revealing to other voters or candidate their identity. This also allows blockPoll to display in real-time (if chosen by the organization) to make public the progress of the election. The API provides a dashboard upon which the progress can be viewed, as well as providing visual metrics should the organization choose to make public the voting progress.

#### Persistence of results

Once created and deployed on the public chain, the contract cannot be destroyed. The data stored by the contact is forever accessible and allows users to see the outcome of an event in the past. This increases both its auditability and immutability as it prevents those with malicious intent to delete the contract in the hope of nullifying the vote.

#### Scalability

blockPoll does not make use of centralized servers. The decentralized nature of the blockchain means that once the contract has been created a deployed, nothing other than a total 51% attack on the ethereum network will prevent the contract from running correctly all the way through to completion. This alleviates the need for trust in central server services, and ensures the immutability and legitimacy of the voting procedure.

#### Cost

Other than the small transaction fee associated with deploying the contract to the network, as well as the almost negligible fee for each voter, the absence of a centralized server alleviates the financial weight of running a proxy (or any other) vote on blockPoll. blockPoll is free to use and open source, and exists therefore only to provide a user friendly blockchain based voting mechanism for the benefit of its own organization. Its open source nature means that any security faults found through testing on the test-net can be resolved timeously to provide a fail-proof robust solution for its users. 

#### Future Proof

Blockchain technology and smart contracts in general are still in the early adoption phase of its life cycle. The entire ecosystem has the potential to grow into one which spans every facet of our lives from how we deal with finance to what goes on in our homes. Being a blockchain based Dapp, blockPoll strives to make use of this evolving technology in a manner that increases efficiency and ease of use in a voting contest. Increased development in the field will bring with it more functionality that blockPoll hopes to employ in the future, should there be a market for it. Its our hope that blockPoll can be used in much larger, more decentralized applications through which any electoral-based projects can make use of the power of blockPoll.  

#### Decentralized

The decentralized nature of the blockchain provides blockpoll with advantages over and above those that exist already. Because all transactions occur with the smart contract and not with a centralized tallying authority, it reduces the burden on chief executives to carry out a seemingly mundane task of counting and verifying votes. The concern of how the voting procedure is run is hard-coded into the contract, and as such made publicly available to all concerning parties, This allows for proper control and supervision of the voting process and increases voter and candidate satisfaction in the fact that their votes are being accounted for correctly. Once finished, disputing the outcome of the election is prevented as there is no central issuing authority who can take responsibility for the outcome. Its decentralized nature ensures shared control between all the nodes on the network, and the consensus between these nodes aids in the auditability and transparency of the entire electorial procedure.

## Features

* Ability for **administrative user** to upload a **CSV file** containg a list of voters and their associated voting power. 
* Ability for **administrative user** to upload a **CSV file** containg a list of possible candidates.
* Ability for **administrative user** to manualy insert a list of voters and their associated voting power.
* Ability for **administrative user** to manualy insert a list of possible candidates.
* Ability for **administrative user** to manualy insert a list of voters or candidates from a stored data base of past voters/candidates.
* Ristrar assigns a **unique Id** - or more simply - their **public key** to each voter known only by the voter and the registrar, allowing for them to see that their vote has been captured correctly in a psuedo-anonomous way. 
* Ability for **adminstrative user** to specify the block number on which they would like the election to begin. If the starting block number is less than the current block, the election will begin as sson as the contract has been deployed.
* Ability for **adminstrative user** to specify the block number on which they would like the election to end.
* Ability for **adminstrative user** to specify whether the voting mechanism is **partial** or **non-partial**.
* The web API dynamically pulls the current gas price from ethgasstation **Put website here** to make it as cheap as possible for the user. This ensures that each transaction is executed with the currelty decided upon minimum amount of gass possible that will still allow the transaction to go through successfully. This provides a good balance between performance and cost. 
* The **web API** provides a wrapper for the contract whereby external third party companies and applications can build around to display current electorcal progress and statistics in a more visually appealing way. This allows companies like CNN and the like to pull from information in the API and intergrate it into thier websites and applications in the manner they see fit. 

## How to use
blockPoll is inteded to be used for the creation, interaction and veiwing of a fully fledged electorial system on a decentralized blockchain. The way it works depends on its user at any given time. 

### Admistrator
An administrator is in charge of creating the voting contract and deploying it on the blockchain. The administrator also acts as a registrar in the sense that they are responsible for inserting both the voters and the voting candidates into the database. The administrator has knowledge of both the name of the voter and his/her private Id key. The administrator should be someone who is not envolved in the voting procedure and must not share publiclally the associated voter with their public key.

#### Instructions
1. The administrator must have access to a list of all voting candidates, as well as a list of voters and their public keys.
2. Navigate to **put web adress here website** 
3. Login to metaMask  -- **Put website in here**. 
4. Select whether or not the election will be run as a **partial** or **non-partial** vote.
5. Select the begin and end block number based on the current block number displayed. If the starting block selected is below the current block number, the election will begin the instant the contract has been created and deployed. Depending on how far in the future you wish to start the election, the time between blocks can be calculated here: **Put website here**.
6. The registrar must then insert both the voters and candidates. This can be done in one of 3 ways:
   * The registrar manually inputs each voter and candidate by typing them into the selected input fields. The registrar also has the option to delete each entry individually if needed.
   * The registrar uploads 2 seperate CSV files containing the voters and voting candidates.
   * Becasue the database stores the names of past input voters and candidates, given that the election has been run before with all or part of the same partiipants, the registrsr is able to select names from a drop-down field of past voters or candidtaes.

### Voter
Depending on the type of vote taking place (**partial** or **non-partial**), a voter has the ability to cast his/her vote. In a **non-partial** vote, the voter will only be able to cast his vote once, and regardless of how much weight they put behind their vote, the contract will ensure that the full voting power they have is allocated to the candidate. Under **partial** voting conditions, the voter is able to vote more than once but cannot vote for multiple candidates during a single transaction. In such an event, the voter must revote and assign as many voting credits as they wish to each candidate. They can continue to do this for as many candidates as they please until all of their voting credits have been assigned to candidates.

#### Instructions

1. Navigate to **put website here**. Here the voter is able to veiw the current status of the election.
2. Input user credentials including assigned weight of vote (Depending on type of election).
3. Click `vote`.
4. Follow MetaMask **Put hyperlink here** promps.

### Viewer
Becasue the voting process is executed by, and stored on a public blockchain, both voters and candidates alike can veiw the current progress of the election. 

#### instructions
1. Go to **PUt URL here**.
2. Search for the public adress of the contract through the interface.
3. If neccessary, veiw the transactionakl history of the contract on the public blockchain.
