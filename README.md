blockPoll is a pseudo-anonymous, online, blockchain-based voting tool to be used to facilitate orginisational-based proxy voting and polling mechanisims for a wide array of uses.

## What is it

By leveraging the power of the Etherium blockchain, coupled with an easy to use web API, blockpoll provides a mechanism whereby both coperate and non-corperate orginisations can conduct voting or polling-like events in a decentralised manner. During the voting process, all participants (voters and candidates) are able to see in real-time the progress results of the under-taken vote without anyone other than the registrar(s) being able to see which voter voteed for which candidate. <br> The final tallied outcome of the vote is also publically accesible to all members, with the same level of anonymity discussed above. The creator of the vote is able to specify the type of proxy voting procedure (partial, non-partial) as well as user decided inout arguments decided upon during contract creation.

## How it works

Given a list of potential candidates, as well as the those who are eligble within the orginisation to vote for said candidates (Deciaided upon by a central autherising commitee within the orginisation), the tool allows an admistrative user to create both partial or non-partial proxy voting schemes. The voting participants are bound to a voting Id generated by the tool. The Id of each voter and the numerical representation of their voting power is made publically available, but the Id-voter pair is known only by the administrator/registrar and the voter itself. By displaying the Id of each voter, as well as who that Id voted for, the current progress of the voting process can be displayed to each voter and cadidate. This means that the voter is able to verifiy that his/her vote has been logged correctly while still preserving the anonymity of the voter. An entherium deployed smart contract manages the creation, tallying of votes and deletion of each instatioated voting contract. This allows for complete immutability of all results, and prevents those with malicious intent from iterfering with the voting process or the results they produce. Additionally, after creation, aslong as the voting process has not yet begun (Start and end date/time decided upon by administrator of the contract through by specifying block numbers), the admistrator is able to delete the contract in the event of a malcreated poll. However, once the specifed begin block has been minned, the contract cannot be deleted, preserving its immutibility and transparancy for the benefit of both those who are voting and the candidates being voted for.

### Editor

* **Drag and Drop** file read.

For more option, see [programming API](http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html) of CodeMirror, and Hack [Markdown Edit](http://github.com/georgeosddev/markdown-edit)

### Converter
To Convert markdown to html, Markdown-Edit Use [Github's API](http://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/#render-a-markdown-document-in-raw-mode) as default.<br>
For more infomation, See official Guide

#### Option: Use [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) as conveter.
If you checked radio `Use marked for conveter` **markdown-edit** use [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)
and [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) instad of Github's API.
It is faster than API call and make you enable to use this app at offline.

*NOTICE* : [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) does not support Anchor.

### Viewer

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/highlightjs/styles/github.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/github-style.css">

### Markdown Syntax

This app is based on [github-flavored-markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)<br>
If you're not already familiar with Markdown, you should spend 15 minutes and go over the excellent [Markdown Syntax Guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) at Daring Fireball.

You can use markdown syntax and also pure html like this.

###### Sample of Table for two
-------------

```
ID  |Name|Rank
----|----|----
1   |Tom Preston-Werner |Awesome
2   |Albert Einstein |Nearly as awesome
```

become

ID  |Name|Rank
----|----|----
1   |Tom Preston-Werner |Awesome
2   |Albert Einstein |Nearly as awesome

and

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>Tom Preston-Werner</td><td>Awesome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Nearly as awesome</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

also become

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>Tom Preston-Werner</td><td>Awesome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Nearly as awesome</td>
  </tr>
</table>
